CTRL//FRAME
CTRL//FRAME is a creative studio built on disruption and fearless design, aiming to empower brands, communities, and creators through expressive, immersive, and socially relevant work. Focused on questioning norms and shaping trends rather than following them, it treats design as a narrative tool for liberation, connection, and impact. Founded as a creative lab blending control (“CTRL”) and perspective (“FRAME”), it thrives on experimentation, collaboration, and originality, valuing emotion, curiosity, and bold ideas over convention and polish to help creators reclaim their canvas and amplify their voices.

Team

The CTRL/FRAME team combines a variety of skills and inventiveness:  Ayabonga Calu, a Bangladeshi actor, model, and influencer, gained notoriety after placing second in the Rang RTV Model Search and has since starred in popular web series and TV dramas, gaining a strong online following; Ahlumile Daka, a dynamic radio host and DJ on Hits Radio Pride and KISS, is known for high-energy performances, celebrity interviews, and advocacy for LGBTQ+ visibility; and Oviweyo Mdunyelwa 2024 Robert J. Kutak Award winner and Dean Emeritus at UC Law San Francisco, a leading voice in legal education and insurance law with extensive leadership experience.
